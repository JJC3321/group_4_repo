https://github.com/bactopia/bactopia/

Contains the raw sequences and links to all the software used in the study as well as a step by step 
guide on GitHub

Paper 4: Generalized leaky integrate-and-fire models classify multiple 
neuron types

Data can be found: http://celltypes.brain-map.org
Analysis code: https://github.com/AllenInstitute/GLIF_Teeter_et_al_2018
Code for creation of the pink noise stimulus: 
https://github.com/AllenInstitute/ephys_pink_noise

Paper seems promising as the data is easily accessible and the github 
provides text files of source code and step by step instructions on which 
codes to run in which order.
