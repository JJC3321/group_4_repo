## SpikeInterface, a unified framework for spike sorting 
**Biologist 1 Paper 1**

This paper is about a tool for bioinformatics research, not biology research. 


## An expanded evaluation of protein function prediction methods shows an improvement in accuracy  
**Biologist 1 Paper 2**

As stated in the repo, "Due to CAFA rules, the organizers of CAFA cannot release the submitted
predictions from participants. Therefore, it is technically not possible to
replicate exact results (figures and tables) in the CAFA2 paper. Also, this
repository is not originally designed to be a software that is reusable as a
whole for protein function prediction tasks in general or even for future
CAFA challenges. As a result, the pipeline is not fully automatized and
manual input is necessary occasionally." Therefore, can't not be reproduced 
due to not releasing the model. 

## Dual-Transformer Cross-Attention Framework for Alzheimer’s disease detection via dPTE-Guided EEG channel selection and multi-modal integration 
**Biologist 2 Paper 1**

Took too long (more than 2 hours) for libraries to download, and there are many decrepit libraries such as ipython_genutils 0.2.0, nose, lockfile and pytz.

## Attentive neural cell instance segmentation
**Biologist 2 Paper 2** 

The github repo does not contain the data. I use Gemini to find it but after finding the dataset; the dataset need cleaning and in my opinion very tedious as each image is in there own folder and there 607 of them. 

## Generalized leaky integrate-and-fire models classify multiple neuron types
**Biologist 1 Paper 4**

The code uses python 2 and python 2 version of libaries like numpy, pandas and allensdk which are no longer supported. 

## Predictive Big Analytics: A study of Parkinson's Disease Using Large, Complex, Heterogenous, Incongruent, Multi-Source and Incomplete Observations
**Biologist 1 Paper 5**

The programming language use for this experiment is R.
