As stated in the repo, "Due to CAFA rules, the organizers of CAFA cannot release the submitted
predictions from participants. Therefore, it is technically not possible to
replicate exact results (figures and tables) in the CAFA2 paper. Also, this
repository is not originally designed to be a software that is reusable as a
whole for protein function prediction tasks in general or even for future
CAFA challenges. As a result, the pipeline is not fully automatized and
manual input is necessary occasionally." Therefore, can't not be reproduced 
due to not releasing the model.
