# Isabella Pelosi — Engineer 2 Notes

## Paper 3 — From Biologist 1  
**Link:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7406220/ (Bacteropia)

### Notes
- **Day 1:**  
  - Installed required mamba version.  
  - Significant lag when downloading Bactopia; test finishing kept hanging.  
  - Next steps would be to attempt running the GitHub-listed code.

- **Day 2:**  
  - Issue with `libmamba` vs other mamba versions.  
  - Planning to attempt installation using Docker or Singularity.  
  - macOS system likely increases run time.

### Additional Notes (10/29)
- Bacteropia is a *tool/model*, not a research project.  
- The referenced paper cannot be used/applied for this project.

### Outcome
- **Works?** No  
- **Contributor:** Isabella Pelosi

## Paper 3 — From Biologist 2

### Notes
- Unable to download paper materials because the Github link was missing from the paper.

### Outcome
- **Works?** No

## Paper 5 — From Biologist 2
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31838499/
### Notes
- Initial conda package download failed due to incompatible Python/conda versions.  
- Updated Python + conda; second failure due to large package size and insufficient disk space.  
- Cleared cache and retried on Storm account.
- Successfully downloaded dataset and models from GitHub.  
- Ran a test model and uploaded results to `group_4_repo` as **MF_results01.txt**.  
- Paper results include machine-learning analysis from external datasets and act as a meta-analysis.  
- Not fully reproducible from provided GitHub data alone—needed clarification from biologists.  
- After further inquiry and additional model runs, results were reproducible.

### Outcome
- **Works?** Yes

## Paper 4 — From Biologist 2

### Notes
- GitHub code only supports running analyses on *new* data.  
- No access to original data used in the paper, so paper results cannot be reproduced.

### Outcome
- **Works?** No  
- **Contributor:** Isabella Pelosi

## Paper 6 — From Biologist 2  
**Link:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38215493/

### Notes
- Code was difficult to implement.  
- Attempted to download the dataset, but it did not contain all features described in the paper.  
- Required unavailable libraries; run time extremely long.

## Paper 7 — From Biologist 2  
**Link:** https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36741395/

### Notes
- Able to download from GitHub and begin implementation.  
- Extremely long run time; conda libraries began hanging.  
- macOS compatibility contributed to issues.  
- Since a paper had already been reproduced, moved on.

  ### Outcome
- **Works?** Maybe - runtime is extremely long
