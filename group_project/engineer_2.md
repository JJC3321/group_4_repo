I attempted downloading Paper 3 from Biologist 1 
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7406220/ Bacteropia
I was able to download mamba version needed but when downloading bactopia there was a lot of lagging and test finishing kept hanging
Next steps after downloading would be to attempt running the codes listed in the github

There is an issue with libmamba instead of the other version of mamba - going to attempt to try to use Docker or singularity to try and download it again. A lot of this is due to the fact that I have a macos system which yields increased run times.s
Other Notes 10/29: Bacteropia is a model / tool not an actual research project. Thus, this paper is not able to be used/applied for this project. 


Paper 3 - From Biologist 2
Paper 3 could not be downloaded due to the fact there was no github link listed within the paper to be able to download.
