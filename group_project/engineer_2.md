I attempted downloading Paper 3 from Biologist 1 
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7406220/ Bacteropia
I was able to download mamba version needed but when downloading bactopia there was a lot of lagging and test finishing kept hanging
Next steps after downloading would be to attempt running the codes listed in the github

There is an issue with libmamba instead of the other version of mamba - going to attempt to try to use Docker or singularity to try and download it again. A lot of this is due to the fact that I have a macos system which yields increased run times.
