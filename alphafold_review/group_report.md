Proteins are essential to all biological functions and its structure 
provides a mechanistic understanding of the function. Previous techniques, 
such as cryo-electron microscopy, require extensive time and equipment to 
determine single protein structures. So far, the structure of 100,000 
proteins have been determined but this only represents a small fraction of 
the billions of known protein sequences. Additionally, previous techniques 
are not always atomically accurate, especially when no homologous proteins 
have been determined. AlphaFold, a machine learning approach, addresses 
these problems by predicting protein structures with high accuracy and 
greater efficiency. 

The computational approach the authors are proposing to use is an approach 
capable of predicting protein structures near experimental accuracy. In 
the past, computational methods to predict three dimensional protein 
structures fell short due to the computational intractability of molecular 
simulation, thus protein structures yielded different results 
experimentally versus theoretically. The authors propose the algorithm 
AlphaFold, which improves the accuracy of structure predictions of protein 
structures. Instead of theorizing protein structures based solely on their 
amino acid chain sequence, AlphaFold incorporates novel neural network 
architectures and training procedures based on the evolutionary, physical 
and geometric contributions to protein structure. Alphafold is a deep 
learning model architecture, which includes supervised and unsupervised 
learning — where users can train neural networks with protein data and 
reward the program based on success and incorporating new data to better 
improve the AlphaFold architecture. This new architecture jointly embeds 
multiple sequence alignments and pairwise features, the program self 
estimates and self corrects the accuracy of the protein structures. 
AlphaFold specifically predicts the 3D coordinates of all the heavy atoms 
within the amino acid sequence of the protein and using the molecular 
stimulation it can predict how all these features would interact to form 
the 3D structure. Overall, Alphafold predicts 3D protein structures 
through deep learning neural networks that enable accurate prediction of 
these protein structures.
